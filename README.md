#Uber Status Readme

Important Note: This application is not ready for any kind of use. 

Disclosure: I work in a fortune 500 company as a IT Project Manager. I am a rookie when it comes to Rails development. The only purpose of this project here is to solve a challenge I have at work with collecting status on large initiatives. 

Intent of the app: This app will try to collect status automatically and will provide transparency of these statuses. At this point the project is infant and I will recommend noone should use it. 

I am using Github thinking that I might get good tips from my peers that are experienced software developers, or other community experts that might be looking for someone to give a hand.
